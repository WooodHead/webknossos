Project setup:
- install java 1.6 (from oracle! don't use openJDK)
- make sure "JAVA_HOME" and "JDK_HOME" are set and PATH contains path to jdk
- download sbt 0.11, rename to sbt-launch.jar and copy it to /bin
- create file "sbt" with following content: 

	java -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xmx2048M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@" 

- make sbt executable
- go to project dir and run "sbt"

Useful sbt commands:
- compile, container:start, container:reload, 
- if "~" prepends a command e.q. "~compile", sbt waits for source changes to execute the command on the fly

Mongodb:
install Mongodb (get the production release from mongodb.org)
unpack (tar -xvf mongo(...).tgz)
move (sudo mv mongo(...) /usr/local/mongodb)
set environment (sudo vim /etc/environment ; append /usr/local/mongodb/bin to path)
logout and login again to reload environment
set up database dir (create (your path)/data/db where you want to save your database)
start mongo: mongod --dbpath (your path)
